# Solidity API

## ConceroProxyAdmin

_This is an auxiliary contract meant to be assigned as the admin of a {TransparentUpgradeableProxy}. For an
explanation of why you would want to use this see the documentation for {TransparentUpgradeableProxy}._

### UPGRADE_INTERFACE_VERSION

```solidity
string UPGRADE_INTERFACE_VERSION
```

_The version of the upgrade interface of the contract. If this getter is missing, both `upgrade(address,address)`
and `upgradeAndCall(address,address,bytes)` are present, and `upgrade` must be used if no function should be called,
while `upgradeAndCall` will invoke the `receive` function if the third argument is the empty byte string.
If the getter returns `"5.0.0"`, only `upgradeAndCall(address,address,bytes)` is present, and the third argument must
be the empty byte string if no function should be called, making it impossible to invoke the `receive` function
during an upgrade._

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(address initialOwner) public
```

_Sets the initial owner who can perform upgrades._

### upgradeAndCall

```solidity
function upgradeAndCall(contract ITransparentUpgradeableProxy proxy, address implementation, bytes data) public payable virtual
```

_Upgrades `proxy` to `implementation` and calls a function on the new implementation.
See {TransparentUpgradeableProxy-_dispatchUpgradeToAndCall}.

Requirements:

- This contract must be the admin of `proxy`.
- If `data` is empty, `msg.value` must be zero._
