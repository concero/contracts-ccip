## [0.2.2] - 15 October 2024

### Dependencies

| Package                   | Version |
| ------------------------- | ------- |
| @chainlink/contracts-ccip | 1.5.0   |
| @chainlink/contracts      | 1.1.1   |

### Services

- [x] Chainlink CCIP
- [x] Chainlink CCIP v1.5
- [x] Chainlink Data Feeds
- [ ] Chainlink Automation
- [ ] Chainlink VRF 2
- [ ] Chainlink VRF 2.5

### Added

- Support for Chainlink CCIP v1.5 (bumped `@chainlink/contracts-ccip` to
  `1.5.0`)
- Added CCIP v1.5 config details to `Register.sol` for all available testnet
  lanes
- Set EVM Version strictly to `paris` for all contracts
- Added `supportNewTokenViaOwner` and `supportNewTokenViaGetCCIPAdmin` functions
  to `CCIPLocalSimulator.sol` instead of `supportNewToken` function
- Added `rmnProxyAddress`, `tokenAdminRegistryAddress` and
  `registryModuleOwnerCustomAddress` to the `NetworkDetails` struct of the
  `Register.sol` smart contract
- Added unit tests for new functions in the `CCIPLocalSimulator.sol` contract
- Added e2e test for new changes in the `CCIPLocalSimulatorFork.sol` contract.
  There is a test with ERC-20 token with an `owner()` function implemented and
  Burn & Mint Pool, and test with ERC-20 token with a `getCCIPAdmin()` function
  implemented and Lock & Release Pool
- Genereted new docs artifacts

### Changed

- Bumped Solidity compiler version from 0.8.19 to 0.8.24
- The `getSupportedTokens()` function now only exists in the
  `CCIPLocalSimulator.sol` contract, it has been removed from the CCIP's
  `Router.sol` contract. Calling that function from the `Router.sol` contract in
  the Forking mode will now revert
- Added `uint32[] memory tokenGasOverrides` as function parameter to the
  `executeSingleMessage` function in the `CCIPLocalSimulatorFork.sol` contract
  to reflect new changes in the CCIP's `EVM2EVMOffRamp.sol` smart contract
- Bumped pragma solidity version of `BasicTokenSender.sol`,
  `CCIPReceiver_Unsafe.sol`, `ProgrammableTokenTransfers` and
  `ProgrammableDefensiveTokenTransfers.sol` contracts from the `src/test` folder
  from `0.8.19` to `0.8.24`

### Removed

- Removed `supportNewToken` function from `CCIPLocalSimulator.sol`
- Removed `CCIPLocalSimulatorV0.sol` and `MockEvm2EvmOffRamp.sol` contracts as
  they have not being used for a while
- Removed `DOCUMENTATION.md` file since the official documentation is now
  available at https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-local
- Removed `remix-001.png` and `remix-002.png` images from the `assets` folder,
  because they are no longer needed
