# GSN Relay Server

[GSN, the Ethereum Gas Station Network](https://opengsn.org/) abstracts away gas to minimize onboarding & UX friction for dapps. 

This module contains Relay Server source code. Note that it is recommended to use a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/opengsn/jsrelay) `opengsn/jsrelay` to run your own Relay Servers.

[Please see the tutorial here.](https://docs.opengsn.org/relay-server/tutorial.html)


You are probably looking for one of these:

`@opengsn/provider` - a Web3 provider for client-facing JavaScript dapps that uses GSN to relay transactions.

`@opengsn/contracts` - all GSN contracts in Solidity language as well as their TypeScript type declarations.

`@opengsn/cli` - command-line tools made to help developers integrate GSN, test their integrations locally, or bring up relay servers on public Ethereum networks.
