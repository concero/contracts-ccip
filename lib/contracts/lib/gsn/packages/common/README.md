# GSN shared components

[GSN, the Ethereum Gas Station Network](https://opengsn.org/) abstracts away gas to minimize onboarding & UX friction for dapps. 

This module is an internal component of other GSN modules. You are probably looking for one of these:

`@opengsn/provider` - a Web3 provider for client-facing JavaScript dapps that uses GSN to relay transactions.

`@opengsn/contracts` - all GSN contracts in Solidity language as well as their TypeScript type declarations.

`@opengsn/cli` - command-line tools made to help developers integrate GSN, test their integrations locally, or bring up relay servers on public Ethereum networks.
